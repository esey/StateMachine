This is an attempt to implement a lightweight state machine.
Some of the goals of the project:

- easy initialization (i.e. avoid complex registration procedures)
- transitions are defined in a data-driven flavour (i.e. a configuration file)
- the states will produce "events" that are used for determining which is the next status
  (i.e. a state does not know anything about the state machine, but it knows which events to produce)
